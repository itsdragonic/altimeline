See the history of our world on a map by scrolling through the timeline.

Once you select the timeline bar, you can use the up and down arrows to look year by year.

[WARNING] Laters years (from 1600-present) can get very laggy and finicky.

### Alternate History

(BETA) Entering a seed value will lead to alternate historical paths.

Seed "0" is our timeline.

Typing any string of characters will lead to unique alternate histories.

(coming soon) Special seeds such as "kaiserreich," "fuhrerreich," or "fallout" will have specific alternate histories.
